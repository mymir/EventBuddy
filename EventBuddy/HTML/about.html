        <h1>Our Mission</h1>
        <p>EventBuddy's mission is to connect college students with their peers
        in a safe, effective way. This app helps students keep track of what
        events are going on, find people to go to events with, and make friends
        with other students on campus. EventBuddy gives students the tools they
        need to participate more on campus and to fully take advantage of everything
        their university has to offer.</p>

        <h1>How To Use This App</h1>
        <p>After a university has signed up for an EventBuddy account, anyone width
        a student email adress can create a profile.</p>
        <p>Once a profile has been created, the student can view and filter through
        different events going on around campus on the <strong>Events</strong> page.</p>
        <p>There they can either join the event, or add the event to their
        <strong>Interested</strong> list. This list lets other students know that this
        student is looking for someone to go to the event with.</p>
        <p>Students can even utalize the <strong>Maps</strong> page to see where events
        are taking place. From there they can click on markers to get more information
        about the event.</p>
